# Links & Resources for Medical Imaging AI

Ideally, you should first check your doubt in ChatGPT or any other LLM app, and search in Google. That's the first step. You form a proper question, and search, experiment, and learn. This is the way to learn in general, and it will suffice for your research journey. Yet, humans are creative, and some posts don't appear on the first page of a Google search. I plan to share some here, and some more, which are important for research in medical AI.

The most important and creative questions are about
* Understanding NN Theory
* Training Neural Nets
* Measuring NN Performance
* Improving NN's Performance
* Organizing NN Experimentation
* Robust, & Interpretable NN
* Building Domain-Enriched NN

For the above questions, the following links along with ChatGPT, Books, Research Papers, and the following practical blogs & resources will help.
