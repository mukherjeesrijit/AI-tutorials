# Medical AI Research Program

This research program program is only for medical professionals, and learners/professionals, who aspire to be medical AI researchers. There are three distinct research roles: reader, applier, and researcher. I have also described a step-by-step approach for each level to learn, and produce output while presenting your work, which is an integral part of research. I have discussed them in my orientation sessions, which you can find below. Since this program is free, the program works the best for you with a good collaboration of your, and my efforts, together. I will anyway give my best efforts. It is therefore up to you, how to make good use of the research program.

## My research, and goal
I firmly believe research is the education of the future. My research focuses on developing domain-enriched AI solutions tailored to particular diseases in medical imaging. Crafting the solutions requires a deep understanding of the imaging, the underlying disease etiology, and the foundational AI techniques. Hence, I am currently focusing on medical imaging for the research direction. I am building this research program so that I can help passionate, and hardworking students to learn, and align with the modern applied AI research processes. This will naturally help me build my research group with interested people with a strong interest in medical AI from backgrounds like Applied Mathematics (Statistics, Economics, Physics), Computer Science, and Medicine. 

## Goal of the program
The program intends to accustom the participants to learn the process of research in medical AI. The program has been naturally designed to make sure that there are tangible outcomes, that can add to your CV so that the process is not practical. This program should ideally build a student for research in applied AI, specifically for medical AI, who plans to do a PhD or move into a research role. Research needs you to learn yourself, and then apply your knowledge. No one will spoon-feed you. Hence, I only share resources, so that you can learn from them and take live classes to clear your doubts and give proper directions and processes for applied AI research in the medical domain. I am doing my duty to help you in whatever small way, I can. The success and impact of the program depend on your effort to use it to the fullest. I will do my best to help you in the process.

## Research Sessions & Posts
The live research orientation sessions introduce you to a well-defined goal and research process and help you get connected to new research areas. My LinkedIn or newsletter posts may help you give insights into research, and concepts in a more deeper way. I teach the research process, that I think is the best for me, and for any researcher. Feel free to perturb it for your benefit, and let me know if you think there is a better way out. You can find the following here:

* Live Sessions / Recordings
* Written & Organized Content
