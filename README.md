# Medical Imaging AI Book

I am writing this book on AI in medical imaging. It is for the students and professionals who want to build a career in Medical Imaging AI. This book will mainly focus on deep learning as a tool, and medical imaging as the data source. This practical book is based on foundations, topics, and research in medical imaging AI. I will refer to the following books for building your foundations in depth, which is preferred:

* [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/) by Marc Peter Deisenroth, A. Aldo Faisal, and Cheng Soon Ong., and
* [Understanding Deep Learning](https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/) by Simon Prince
